In ROS, the RobotModel_ and RobotState_ classes are the core classes that give you access to a robotâ€™s kinematics.

In the kinematic model of a robot, the connection of different manipulator joints is known as link, and the integration of two or more links is called a joint. This kinematic model can be represented as a tree structure. The tree describes the kinematic chain, i.e., the connection of robotic links with joints, and the inter-dependendencies of these links. In ROS, this tree structure plus the underlying geometric information is defined in XML format in a URDF file, and is stored in the class RobotModel_.

Links
==================
Robot links are thee solid mechanical elements. Depending on the kinematic model, movement of certain input links allows the output links to move at various motions.

Joints
==================
The joints are the elements in a robot which helps the links to travel in different kind of movements. The two major types of joints are:

* Rotational joint
* Linear joint

Furthermode, joints can be defined as fixed, active (controllable), or passive (uncontrollable).

The RobotState_ class in ROS contains information about the robot at a snapshot in time, storing vectors of joint positions and optionally velocities and accelerations. The RobotState_ also contains helper functions for setting the arm location based on the end effector location (Cartesian pose) and for computing Cartesian trajectories.
