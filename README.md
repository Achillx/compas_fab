## How to contribute?

Beyond using this package, you can also help develop it further.
The local development environment does not differ much from just using it.

All local development tasks are handled by `pyinvoke` through the `inv` (aka `invoke`) command.

To build the documentation locally:

    $ inv build

To run all docstring tests/examples:

    $ inv doctest
