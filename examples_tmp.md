# Examples for compas_fab introduction

1. Introduction of `Frame`, `Transformation`, (RR)
   * Better examples
1. Introduction of `Pose`, `BaseConfiguration`, `Link`, `Joint`, `Robot`, `UR`, `ABB`
   * Check overlaps of ROS `Pose` and other classes
   * Clean `Robot`, `Link`, `Joint`, `Tool`
1. Robot model and kinematic chain (have the same model in Rhino and Blender?)
   * Robot model from URDF
1. Plan a path with XX robot in setup (change robot model, calculate new path, obstacles?)
   * For ROBArch WS: already with moveit? or only with Vrep?
   * Message types in ROS
1. Robot communication
   * Changing the driver (ABB, UR)?
   * Extend to cartesian pose?
1. Send path to robot and execute. Wait until done to send again.
1. Send path to robot and turn digital output on/off while moving.

TODO:
* rename grasshopper to ghpython
* ROS in a box
