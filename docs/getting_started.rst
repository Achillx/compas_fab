Getting started
********************************************************************************

Installation
============

The recommended way to install **compas_fab** is to use `Anaconda/conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_:

::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install COMPAS
    pip install compas_fab


Once installed, you can verify your setup. Start Python from the command line and run the following:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import compas_fab


Environments
============

Just like the main library of **COMPAS**, the core functionality of **compas_fab**
is independent of CAD software and can be used from the command line,
in standalone scripts.


Working in Rhino
----------------

*Installing* **compas_fab** for Rhino is very simple. Just open the *command prompt*
and type the following

::

    python -m compas_fab.rhino.install


Optionally, you could provide a Rhino version number (``'5.0', '6.0'``).
The default is ``'5.0'``.

::

    python -m compas_fab.rhino.install '6.0'


Working in Blender
------------------

Once **COMPAS** itself is installed for Blender following the documented procedure,
**compas_fab** will automatically be available as well after installing it.
