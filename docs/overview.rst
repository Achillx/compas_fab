Overview
********************************************************************************

**Robotic fabrication package for the COMPAS Framework** that facilitates the planning and execution of robotic fabrication processes.
It provides interfaces to existing software libraries and tools available in the field of robotics (e.g. OMPL, ROS) and makes them
accessible from within the parametric design environment. The package builds upon `COMPAS <https://compas-dev.github.io/>`_,
an open-source Python-based framework for collaboration and research in architecture, engineering and digital fabrication.

Main features
=============

* Planning & execution tools
* CAD-independent
* Robotic fabrication process modeling
* Mediates between tools & libraries
* Multiple robotic backends (e.g. `ROS: Robot Operating System <https://ros.org>`_)

**compas_fab** runs on Python 2.x, 3.x and IronPython 2.7.

**compas_fab** is still under very active development, with new versions being released
frequently. The interface is not guaranteed to remain stable until the package
reaches version ``1.0.0``.
