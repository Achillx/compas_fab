.. In ROS, the RobotModel_ and RobotState_ classes are the core classes that give you access to a robot's kinematics.

In the kinematic model of a robot, the connection of different manipulator joints is known as link, and the integration of two or more links is called a joint. This kinematic model can be represented as a tree structure. The tree describes the kinematic chain, i.e., the connection of robotic links with joints, and the inter-dependendencies of these links. This tree structure plus the underlying geometric information can be defined in Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), which describes any robot (see for example UR5urdf_). If the robot is mounted on external axes, these links and joints can be added as well.

    An industrial robot's links and joints, and the according tree structure describing the kinematic model.
    .. Actually it would be good to have here a robot on a linear axis...

Links
==================
Robot links are solid mechanical elements. Depending on the kinematic model, movement of certain input links allows the output links to move at various motions.

Joints
==================
The joints are the elements in a robot which helps the links to travel in different kind of movements. The three major types of joints are:

* revolute - a hinge joint that rotates along the axis and has a limited range specified by the upper and lower limits
* prismatic - a sliding joint that slides along the axis, and has a limited range specified by the upper and lower limits
* fixed - not really a joint because it cannot move, all degrees of freedom are locked. ::

    from compas.robots import Joint
    from compas.robots import Link

    link = Link("world")
    joint = Joint("world-joint", parent="world")
    link = Link("j0")
    joint = Joint("j0")
    # TODO: built own robot here

.. The RobotState_ class in ROS contains information about the robot at a snapshot in time, storing vectors of joint positions and optionally velocities and accelerations. The RobotState_ also contains helper functions for setting the arm location based on the end effector location (Cartesian pose) and for computing Cartesian trajectories.
