********************************************************************************
Creating a MoveIt! package from the custom created URDF
********************************************************************************

1. Start the MoveIt! Setup Assistant
====================================

The MoveIt! Setup Assistant is a graphical user interface for configuring any 
robot for use with MoveIt!. Its primary function is generating a Semantic Robot
Description Format (SRDF) file for your robot.

* To start the MoveIt! Setup Assistant::

    roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch
    
* Press *Create New MoveIt Configuration Package*
* Click on the browse button and navigate to the ``ur5_with_measurement_tool.urdf`` 
  file you created in the last example. Choose that file and then click 
  *Load Files.* The Setup Assistant will load the files (this might take a few 
  seconds) and present you with this screen:

2. Generate Self-Collision Matrix
====================================

* Click on the *Self-Collisions* pane selector on the left-hand side.
* Click on the *Generate Collision Matrix* button. The Setup Assistant will work for a few
  seconds before presenting you the results of its computation in the main table.

Note:
    The sampling density specifies how many random robot positions to check for self
    collision. The default value of 10'000 collision checks should be fine.

3. Add Virtual Joints
=====================

Virtual joints are used primarily to attach the robot to the world coordinate 
frame. We will define only one virtual joint, attaching the 
``ur5_with_measurement_tool`` to the world coordinate frame.

* Click on the *Virtual Joints* pane selector. Click on *Add Virtual Joint*
* Set the joint name as "virtual_joint"
* Set the child link as "base_link" and the parent frame name as "world".
* Set the Joint Type as "fixed".
* Click *Save*.

4. Add Planning Groups
======================

Planning groups are used for semantically describing different parts of your 
robot, such as defining what an arm is, or an end-effector. The planning group
is later used for path- and motion planning.

* Click on the *Planning Groups* pane selector.
* Click on *Add Group* and you should see the following screen:

.. figure:: 08_ros_create_moveit_package_03.JPG
    :figclass: figure
    :class: figure-img img-fluid

Add the arm
-----------

* Enter *Group Name* as "manipulator"
* Choose ur_kinematics/UR5KinematicsPlugin as the kinematics solver.
* Let *Kin. Search Resolution*, *Kin. Search Timeout (sec)*, *Kin. Solver Attempts* and
  *Group Default Planner* stay at their default values.

.. figure:: 08_ros_create_moveit_package_04.JPG
    :figclass: figure
    :class: figure-img img-fluid

* Click on the *Add Kin. Chain* button. Press *Expand All*

.. figure:: 08_ros_create_moveit_package_05.JPG
    :figclass: figure
    :class: figure-img img-fluid
    
* Select the "base_link" as *Base Link* and the "tcp" as *Tip Link*
* Press the *Save* button.


Add the gripper
---------------

We will also add a group for the end-effector. 

Note:
    You will do this using a different procedure than adding the arm.

* Click on the *Add Group* button.
* Enter *Group Name* as "measurement_tool"
* Let *Kinematic Solver*, *Kin. Search Resolution*, *Kin. Search Timeout (sec)*, *Kin. Solver Attempts* and
  *Group Default Planner* stay at their default values.
* Click on the *Add Links* button.
* Choose measurment_tool and tcp (The links you defined in the measurement_tool.xacro) and add them to the list of *Selected Links* on     the right hand side.
* Click *Save*

5. Add Robot Poses
==================

The *Setup Assistant* allows you to add certain fixed poses into the 
configuration. This helps if, for example, you want to define a certain position
of the robot as a *Home* position.

* Click on the *Robot Poses* pane.
* Click *Add Pose*. Choose a name for the pose. The robot will be in its 
  *Default* position where the joint values are set to the mid-range of the 
  allowed joint value range. Move the individual joints around until you are happy
  and then *Save* the pose. Note how poses are associated with particular groups.
  You can save individual poses for each group.
* IMPORTANT TIP: Try to move all the joints around. If there is something wrong 
  with the joint limits in your URDF, you should be able to see it immediately here.

6. Label End-Effectors
======================

We have already added the measurement_tool of the ur5. Now, we will designate 
this group as a special group: end effectors. Designating this group as end 
effectors allows some special operations to happen on them internally.

* Click on the *End Effectors* pane.
* Click *Add End Effector*.
* Choose ``measurement_tool`` as the *End Effector Name* for the measurement tool.
* Select "measurement_tool" as the *End Effector Group*.
* Select "tool0" as the *Parent Link* for this end-effector.
* Leave *Parent Group* empty.
* Press *Save*.

7. Add Passive Joints
=====================

Skip this step.

8. Add Author Information
=========================

* Click on the *Author Information* pane.
* Enter your name and email address.

9. Generate Configuration Files
===============================

You are almost there. One last step - generating all the configuration files that you will need to start using MoveIt!

* Click on the Configuration Files pane. 
* Click *Browse*, select the ``robotic_setups/src`` location. Click *Create New Folder*, call it "ur5_with_measurement_tool_moveit_config", and click *Choose*. 
* Click on the *Generate Package* button. The Setup Assistant will now generate and write a set of launch and config files into the directory of your choosing. All the generated files will appear in the Generated Files/Folders tab and you can click on each of them for a description of what they contain.
